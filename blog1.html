                    Cell-cell interactions have played a significant role in the development of multicellular organisms.
                    Understanding the spatial location of genes along with their expression can provide valuable
                    insights for dissecting cellular functions and phenotypic state. This has been enabled by spatial
                    transcriptomics that unravel the tissue architecture and provide a clear picture of the biological
                    landscape. Interestingly, recent technological advancements have made spatial transcriptomics more
                    accessible. The need for Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technology can be understood in the context of
                    its application to crucial areas such as the tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor heterogeneity,
                    developmental biology, neuroscience, and regenerative medicine.</p>

                    The primers also contain the spatial barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that represent
                    the coordinates of each array. When the tissue is permeabilized, the mRNA molecules in the tissue

                    embryos, tissues, and organs across various species, supported by a substantial body of literature
                    [Rao et al, Garcia-Alonso et al]. Notably, it has advanced the understanding of embryogenesis. By
                    analyzing tissues at different developmental stages, Visium can provide insights into the temporal
                    dynamics of gene expression crucial for studying molecular processes like embryonic development,
                    wound healing, and tissue regeneration. Visium supports both fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed,

                    diverse disease contexts. With the currently fast-moving progress and promising results from early
                    adopted research projects, we can foresee the bright future of such new tools in understanding life
                    at the most profound analytical level. 10X Visium has significantly amplified the capabilities of
                    single cell sequencing technologies in identifying and characterizing cell types and states.
                    Understanding the functional roles of different cell types necessitates their physical localization
                    and interactions. The spatial dimension provided by 10X Visium enables precise analysis of cell
                    populations, neighboring cell interactions, and overall cellular structural organization. Other than
                    transcriptomics, the proteome, neuronal connectome, and 3D chromatin conformation are crucial to
                    cell function, and methods like DBiT-seq and MERFISH, have been developed to profile these along

                    predicting patient survival [Zhao et al]. CD56+ immune cells are predictive of outcomes following

                    also in translating findings into clinical practice, enhancing personalized medicine approaches
                    across diverse disease contexts. With the currently fast-moving progress and promising results from
                    early adopted research projects, we can foresee the bright future of such new tools in understanding

                    of single cell sequencing technologies in identifying and characterizing cell types and states.
                    Understanding the functional roles of different cell types necessitates their physical localization

                <p class="pt-2">The future holds lot of promises in this direction along with scope to integrate data
                    into comprehensive databases. The introduction of modern querying using AI models and visualization
                    techniques is the way forward. Despite progress, achieving this vision will likely require continued
                    development and integration of diverse techniques and technologies. Integration of such
                    high-dimensional technologies into routine clinical use is not an easy task as multiple steps remain
                    before preclinical findings are integrated into clinical practice. XANA where “data means more”
